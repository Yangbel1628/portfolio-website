# 🎨 Portfolio Website

Hey there! Welcome to my digital corner on the internet.  
This is where I showcase who I am, what I build, and what I love to do — all neatly packed into a handcrafted website.

## 🧩 What’s Inside?

A clean and simple HTML + CSS powered portfolio — no JavaScript magic, just pure structure and style.  
It’s lightweight, responsive, and designed with UI/UX in mind — because first impressions matter.

You’ll find:

- A quick intro to who I am
- Highlights of my projects (yep, those late-night code sessions paid off)
- A way to connect if you’re interested in collaborating

## 💡 Tech Behind the Scenes

> No frameworks. No libraries. Just old-school craftsmanship.

- HTML5 — for structure  
- CSS3 — for style and layout  
- Vercel — for fast, free deployment

## 🧠 Why This Portfolio?

I wanted a portfolio that **loads fast**, **looks clean**, and **says enough without saying too much**.  
This site reflects my design sense and attention to small details — no bloated code, just what matters.
